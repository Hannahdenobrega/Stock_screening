Streamlit stock dashboard created in Python


 In this repo I built a stock dashboard using Python. Streamlit web app is a great open source app framework in Python language.
 - I use yfinance to extract stock price on Streamlit 
 - Tabs for pricing, fundamental, and stock news analysis
 - Stock Price analysis on Streamlit 
 - Stock fundamental data using Alpha vantage 
 - Stock News analysis on Streamlit
